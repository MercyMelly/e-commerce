E-Commerce Database Schema Documentation
Our database schema provides a robust foundation for managing all aspects of an e-commerce platform, from product catalog management to inventory tracking. Designed with scalability and performance in mind, the schema enforces data integrity while supporting complex business operations through carefully structured relationships and constraints.

**Core Structure**
The relational model centers around products and their variations, with supporting tables for brands, categories, and attributes. Key features include:
  Hierarchical product categories with self-referencing parent-child relationships
  Multi-variant product system supporting color/size/custom variations
  Flexible attribute management with categorized attributes of different types
  Inventory tracking at the individual product item level (SKU-based)

**Data Integrity Enforcement**
  The schema implements strict relational constraints:
  Foreign key relationships with appropriate cascade rules (RESTRICT, CASCADE, SET NULL)
  Validation triggers that prevent invalid data (e.g., negative prices)
  Automatic inventory adjustment through order processing triggers
  Unique constraints on critical business fields like SKU values

**Performance Optimization**
  Strategic indexing ensures efficient querying:
  Foreign key indexes on all relationship columns
  Composite indexes for common join patterns
  Full-text search capability on product names/descriptions
  Specialized indexes for price ranges and inventory status checks

**Business Logic Implementation**
  Pre-built database operations include:
  Product variant retrieval (with aggregated variation details)
  Inventory management procedures for stock adjustments
  Search functionality with natural language processing
  Catalog views with pre-joined product/brand/category data

**Reporting & Analytics**
  Ready-to-use views provide:
  Inventory status dashboards (with stock level classifications)
  Product variation overviews (all options in human-readable format)
  Catalog exports with primary image references

**Development Support**
  The optional sample data set:
  Demonstrates real-world usage patterns
  Provides test cases for all relationship types
  Includes representative products across categories
  Shows variation implementations for different product types

This comprehensive schema balances normalization for data integrity with practical considerations for e-commerce performance. The inclusion of both structural elements and business logic components ensures the database can immediately support core platform functionality while remaining adaptable for future enhancements and improvements.
